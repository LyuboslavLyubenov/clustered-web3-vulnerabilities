**Original Text Preview:**

The [`SwapProxy` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L26) contains the [`performSwap` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L67), which allows the caller to execute a swap in two ways: [by approving or sending tokens to the specified exchange](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L81-L84), or by [approving tokens through the `Permit2` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L86-L101). However, since it is possible to supply any address as the `exchange` parameter and any call data through the `routerCalldata` parameter of the `performSwap` function, the `SwapProxy` contract may be forced to perform an [arbitrary call to an arbitrary address](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L108).

This could be exploited by an attacker, who could force the `SwapProxy` contract to call the [`invalidateNonces` function](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L113) of the `Permit2` contract, specifying an arbitrary spender and a nonce higher than the current one. As a result, the nonce for the given (token, spender) pair will be [updated](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L124). If the `performSwap` function is called again later, it [will attempt to use a subsequent nonce](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L95), which has been invalidated by the attacker and the code inside `Permit2` will [revert due to nonces mismatch](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L138).

As the `performSwap` function is the only place where the nonce passed to the `Permit2` contract is updated, the possibility of swapping a given token on a certain exchange will be blocked forever, which impacts all the functions of the [`SpokePoolPeriphery` contract](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts/blob/b84dbfae35030e0f2caa5509b632c10106a32330/contracts/SpokePoolPeriphery.sol#L140) related to swapping tokens. The attack may be performed for many different (tokens, exchange) pairs.

Consider not allowing the `exchange` parameter to be equal to the `Permit2` contract address.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation leads to unauthorized operations, incorrect routing, or unintended token transfers, enabling denial-of-service, fund loss, or malicious redirection.  

**Original Text Preview:**

`swapActive()` is called by critical flows:

1. `stateChangeActive()` --> `swapActive()`.
2. `sync()` --> `_poke()` --> `_closeTrustedFill()` --> `closeFiller()` --> `swapActive()`.

**Case1:**
External integrating protocol calls `stateChangeActive()` and wants to see `(false, false)` before trusting the Folio state. Suppose:

- `sellAmount` is `100`.
- `sellTokenBalance` is `98` i.e. swap is still active and only partial sell has occurred.
- Ideally external protocol should see `(false, true)`.
- Attack scenario: Attacker front runs the call to `stateChangeActive()` and donates `2` sellTokens.
- Now, inside the `swapActive()` function, `if (sellTokenBalance >= sellAmount)` evaluates to `true`, and swap is reported as completed i.e. `false` is returned.
- External protocol trusts an inconsistent state & balance.

Note that a similar attack can be mounted by donating buyTokens which would result in `minimumExpectedIn > buyToken.balanceOf(address(this))` to return `false` instead of `true`.

**Case2:**
Ideally all `sync()` modifier protected functions should revert if swaps are active because `closeFiller()` checks that:

```js
require(!swapActive(), BaseTrustedFiller__SwapActive());
```

Almost all the critical Folio functions like `mint()`, `redeem()`, `distributeFees()` etc are protected by `sync()`. But due to the same attack path as above, protocol can be fooled into believing that the swap has concluded. This allows the function calls to proceed and potentially end up in an inconsistent state.

**Recommendations:**

Track balance internally through accounting variables instead of using `balanceOf()` inside `swapActive()`.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate critical inputs (addresses, chain IDs, token data) during initialization or execution, leading to invalid state, reentrancy, or unauthorized operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Severity

**Impact**: High, malicious attacker can set L2 custom address to different address to break the bridge token.

**Likelihood**: Medium, attacker can front-ran the `registerTokenOnL2` to break the bridge token.

## Description

tSQD is designed so that it can be bridged from Ethereum (L1) to Arbitrum (L2) via Arbitrumâ€™s generic-custom gateway.
However, the `registerTokenOnL2` function, which sets the L2 token address via `gateway.registerTokenToL2`, is not currently restricted.

```solidity
  function registerTokenOnL2(
    address l2CustomTokenAddress,
    uint256 maxSubmissionCostForCustomGateway,
    uint256 maxSubmissionCostForRouter,
    uint256 maxGasForCustomGateway,
    uint256 maxGasForRouter,
    uint256 gasPriceBid,
    uint256 valueForGateway,
    uint256 valueForRouter,
    address creditBackAddress
  ) public payable {
    require(!shouldRegisterGateway, "ALREADY_REGISTERED");
    shouldRegisterGateway = true;

    gateway.registerTokenToL2{value: valueForGateway}(
      l2CustomTokenAddress, maxGasForCustomGateway, gasPriceBid, maxSubmissionCostForCustomGateway, creditBackAddress
    );

    router.setGateway{value: valueForRouter}(
      address(gateway), maxGasForRouter, gasPriceBid, maxSubmissionCostForRouter, creditBackAddress
    );

    shouldRegisterGateway = false;
  }
```

An attacker can front-run the `registerTokenOnL2` and put an incorrect address for `l2CustomTokenAddress` to break the bridge token. Once it is called, the L2 token cannot be changed inside the gateway.

## Recommendations

Use the Ownable functionality inside tSQD and restrict `registerTokenOnL2` so that it can only be called by the owner/admin, as suggested by the Arbitrum bridge token design.
