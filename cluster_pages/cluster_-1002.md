# Cluster -1002

**Rank:** #438  
**Count:** 8  

## Label
Lack of SPDX license identifiers compromises legal clarity and trust by creating ambiguity in licensing terms, exposing projects to intellectual property risks and undermining auditability and compliance in smart contracts.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 8

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Missing license declarations lead to legal ambiguity, compliance risks, and unclear intellectual property rights, undermining auditability and lawful usage in decentralized systems.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## License Information

## Context
GovNFT/contracts/

## Description
The license has recently been modified to GPL-3.0. A LICENSE or COPYING file is required to be distributed with the code per GNU specification.

## Recommendation
Add a LICENSE or COPYING file to the repository for license adherence.

## Velodrome
The recommended fix has been applied (added the `license.md` file to the project's root). See commit `16ecc140`.

## Cantina Managed
Fix confirmed.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Missing license declarations lead to legal ambiguity, compliance risks, and unclear intellectual property rights, undermining auditability and lawful usage in decentralized systems.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `RDA.sol` file is missing License Identifier as the first line of the file, which is a compiler warning. Add the `No License` license at least to remove the compiler warning.
