# Cluster -1062

**Rank:** #120  
**Count:** 132  

## Label
Failure to validate input data or transaction outcomes leads to unauthorized asset transfers, bypassed invariants, or unintended function executions, enabling exploitation through invalid signatures, missing approvals, or flawed logic ordering.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Missing input or state validation leads to exploitable fee or parameter manipulation, enabling incorrect logic, overflow, or unfair economic outcomes.  

**Original Text Preview:**

In the `updateFeeToken`, `updateFeeAmount`, and `updateFeeTo` functions, the fee config is not checked to ensure it has been properly set beforehand. As a result, an editor could mistakenly update the fee config for a chain ID where the fee config has not been set.

Example of impact: If the editor updates the fee token, the fee config could not be set for that chain ID.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation and bounds checking enable attackers to manipulate or nullify fees, leading to loss of value, unauthorized fee redirection, or system failure through improper parameter handling.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** `PolygonStrategy::addFee` does not check if `_feeBasisPoints > 0` when adding a new fee element to the `fees` array. This is inconsistent with the `PolygonStrategy::updateFee` logic where `_feeBasisPoints = 0` triggers a removal of the fee element from the `fees` array.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider introducing a non-zero check to `_feeBasisPoints`.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Insufficient input validation and bounds checking enable attackers to manipulate or nullify fees, leading to loss of value, unauthorized fee redirection, or system failure through improper parameter handling.  

**Original Text Preview:**

## Description
The `setupFee` function lacks validation for the `feeTo` parameter, which could potentially allow setting a zero address as the fee recipient. The contract has two functions for managing fee recipients: `setupFee` for initial configuration and `updateFeeTo` for subsequent changes. The `updateFeeTo` function validates that `feeTo` is not the zero address, indicating that sending fees to the zero address is considered invalid. However, this same validation is missing in the `setupFee` function despite setting the same critical parameter.

This inconsistency creates a security gap during the initial fee setup while preventing the same issue during updates, suggesting an oversight rather than a deliberate design decision.

## Exploit Scenario
An administrator with the `EDITOR_ROLE` accidentally sets the `feeTo` parameter to the zero address when initially configuring fees for a new chain using the `setupFee` function. All fees collected for transactions on that chain are sent to the zero address and become permanently inaccessible.

## Recommendations
- **Short term**: Add the missing validation check to `setupFee` to match the validation in `updateFeeTo`.
- **Long term**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for initialization scenarios. Create test cases that explicitly check for proper validation of critical parameters during initial configuration and ensure consistency between initial setup and update functions.
