##### Description

The logic in the `stake` function includes two inefficiencies:

  

1. **Redundant Balance Comparison**: The function calculates `stakingAmount` by comparing the contract’s token balance before and after the transfer. This approach is unnecessary and gas-inefficient. Instead, the `_amount` parameter can be used directly, or it can be replaced with more accurate validations, such as checking the sender's balance and allowance.
2. **Unnecessary Conditional Update**: The user’s stake (`userStake.amount`) is updated with conditional logic based on whether `userStake.amount > 0`. This separation is redundant, as a direct addition would achieve the same result with less complexity.

  

Code Location
-------------

Code of `stake` function from **Staking.sol** contract.

```
Stake storage userStake = stakeInfo[_beneficiary];

uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(
	msg.sender,
	address(this),
	_amount
);
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this));

uint256 stakingAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

// Update user's stake
if (userStake.amount > 0) {
	userStake.amount += stakingAmount;
} else {
	userStake.amount = stakingAmount;
}

totalStaked += stakingAmount;
```

##### Recommendation

It is recommended to:

  

1. Replace the balance comparison logic with either directly using the `_amount` parameter or validating the sender’s balance and allowance beforehand to ensure they have sufficient tokens and approval.
2. Simplify the logic for updating `userStake.amount` by directly adding the staking amount to the existing value, regardless of whether it is initially zero.

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate contract token balances before operations, leading to potential fund loss, incorrect state transitions, or unauthorized transactions due to insufficient or unverified balance checks.  

**Original Text Preview:**

Code uses `_balances[address(this)].classA` to get the contract's token balance during the migration and withdrawal of excess funds. The issue is that the contract address may have `classB` balance too and those funds won't be used in migration and the deployer can't withdraw them too. It's possible to transfer `classB` balance to the contract address or buy tokens for the contract address which would increase the `classB` balance of the contract address. It would be better to use `balanceOf(This)` to get the contract's balance to make sure there would be no leftovers.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Failure to validate contract identity or interface type leads to unauthorized or misinterpreted token operations, enabling spoofed assets, incorrect transfers, or insecure interactions with non-compliant or forged implementations.

## Context
**UsualM.sol#L108**

## Description
`wrappedM` has another `permit()` function that takes in `bytes memory signature` instead of the `(v, r, s)` tuple to allow smart contract wallets to verify signatures and authorize approvals, as per ERC1271. Currently, this functionality is not supported in the implementation, which would limit compatibility with smart contract wallets.

## Recommendation
Consider overloading the `permit` function to support smart contract permits.

### Function
```solidity
function wrapWithPermit(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 deadline,
    bytes calldata signature
)
```
