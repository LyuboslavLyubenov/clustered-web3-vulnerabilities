# Cluster -1039

**Rank:** #35  
**Count:** 580  

## Label
Redundant validation and control flow checks that fail to enforce critical invariants, leading to unnecessary gas costs, potential state corruption, or inconsistent executionâ€”often due to poor logic design or lack of abstraction.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Redundant condition checks and unnecessary state mutations lead to inefficiency, increased gas costs, and potential logic errors or race conditions in critical control flows.  

**Original Text Preview:**

The `_reset` function in the `Voter` contract contains a redundant check for the variable `_votes`, which is of type `uint256`.

```solidity
uint256 _votes = votes[_tokenId][_pool];
```

The first `if` statement checks whether `_votes` is not equal to zero. However, since `_votes` is a `uint256`, it cannot be negative, and if it is not zero, it must be greater than zero. Therefore, the second check for `_votes` > 0 is redundant and leads to unreachable code in the `else` block.

```solidity
if (_votes != 0) {
    _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
    weights[_pool] -= _votes;
    votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
    if (_votes > 0) {
        IBribe(internal_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(
            uint256(_votes),
            _tokenId
        );
        IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(
            uint256(_votes),
            _tokenId
        );
        _totalWeight += _votes;
    } else {
        _totalWeight -= _votes;
    }
}
```

It is recommended to remove the redundant check for `_votes > 0` and simplify the code.

        );
        _totalWeight += _votes;
    } else {
        _totalWeight -= _votes;
    }
}
```

It is recommended to remove the redundant check for `_votes > 0` and simplify the code.

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Redundant state mutations and unnecessary storage operations that waste gas, introduce inefficiency, and risk unintended state inconsistencies without affecting functionality.  

**Original Text Preview:**

**Description:** Both `pUSDeVault` and `yUSDeVault` inherit the `PreDepositVault` which in turn inherits the `PreDepositPhaser`; however, there is an inconsistency between the state of `pUSDe::currentPhase`, which is updated when the phase changes, and `yUSDe::currentPhase`, which is never updated and is thus always the default `PointsPhase` variant. This is assumedly not an issue given that this state is never needed for the yUSDe vault, though a view function is exposed by virtue of the state variable being public which could cause confusion.

**Recommended Mitigation:** The simplest solution would be modifying this state to be internal by default and only expose the corresponding view function within `pUSDeVault`.

**Strata:** Fixed in commit [aac3b61](https://github.com/Strata-Money/contracts/commit/aac3b617084fb5a06b29728a9f52e5884b062b6a).

**Cyfrin:** Verified. The `yUSDeVault` now returns the `pUSDeVault` phase state.
