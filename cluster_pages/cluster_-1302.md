## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Unused code elements introduce unnecessary complexity, expand attack surface, and increase risk of unintended state changes or future exploitation through dead paths and poor maintainability.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The `DIAExternalStaking` contract contains a redundant import statement: `import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol";`. This import is unnecessary if `IERC20` is already imported from another OpenZeppelin location such as `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol`. Including duplicate imports can cause confusion, increase compilation time, and lead to inconsistencies if different versions of the same interface are referenced.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the duplicate `IERC20` import from `@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol` if it is not specifically required. Ensure that only a single, consistent source of the `IERC20` interface is used throughout the contract to maintain clarity and avoid potential mismatches.

> duplicate import is removed

### Example 2

**Auto Label:** Unused code elements introduce unnecessary complexity, expand attack surface, and increase risk of unintended state changes or future exploitation through dead paths and poor maintainability.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
This issue has been identified within the `DIARewardsDistribution` contract.
The `REWARDS_TOKEN` variable is declared as an immutable public variable but is not used anywhere in the contract.
The issue is classified as **Low** severity because unused variables can lead to confusion for future maintainers or auditors.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the `REWARDS_TOKEN` variable from the contract if it is not required.

> **Client's Commentary:**
> unused REWARDS_TOKEN is removed

### Example 3

**Auto Label:** Unused code elements introduce unnecessary complexity, expand attack surface, and increase risk of unintended state changes or future exploitation through dead paths and poor maintainability.  

**Original Text Preview:**

##### Description
The `setDailyWithdrawalThreshold()` function allows the owner to modify the daily withdrawal threshold but appears to serve no purpose in the current implementation. Dead code increases contract size, deployment costs, and potential attack surface while providing no functional benefit. Additionally, the function contains the same redundant zero check issue (`if (newThreshold <= 0)`) as other threshold functions, suggesting it was copied without proper review. Maintaining unused functions can lead to confusion during future development and may introduce unexpected behaviors if accidentally called.

There are also unused storage variables like `withdrawalCap`, `totalDailyWithdrawals`, `lastWithdrawalResetDay`, `dailyWithdrawalThreshold`.

And `withdrawalCapBps` variable with the corresponding `setWithdrawalCapBps` function is also never used.
<br/>
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the unused functions and storage variables from `DIAStakingCommons` to reduce contract size, eliminate dead code, and improve code maintainability.

> dead code is removed
