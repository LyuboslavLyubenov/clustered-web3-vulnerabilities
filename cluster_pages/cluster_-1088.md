**Rank:** #277  
**Count:** 29  

## Label
Memory management flaws leading to undefined behavior, data corruption, or state inconsistencies due to improper memory allocation, pointer handling, or failure to distinguish between memory and storage.

## Cluster Information
- **Total Findings:** 29

## Examples

### Example 1

**Auto Label:** Inconsistent state management due to improper array indexing, missing deletions, or flawed iterator/ordering, leading to data corruption, incorrect state transitions, and erroneous operations.

## Lock Removal in SmartTable

When a lock is removed, it is not actually deleted from the SmartTable storing lock records. This renders the data accessible in the system even after it is supposedly removed. Since locks are not fully removed from the SmartTable, view functions may show locks that should have been deleted. 

Also, the `lock_index` is not validated to ensure it is within the bounds of the investor’s lock count. Thus, the `lock_index` values may be out of bounds, potentially attempting to delete nonexistent records. As a result, the same lock may be removed multiple times repeatedly, each time decreasing the lock count.

## Remediation

- Check that `lock_index <= total_investor_count` in both the view functions and the removal function.

## Patch

Resolved in 06538b8.

## RedstoneConsumerBase.sol Analysis

## Context
`RedstoneConsumerBase.sol#L114-L120`

## Description
In this function, the free memory pointer is shifted inside a loop to "free" memory that can be reused in order to avoid new allocations. However, afterwards, the `dataPackageIndex` variable is declared, which may or may not be allocated into memory depending on compiler settings. 

Different Solidity versions may choose to place variables in memory even when they can use the stack, and different settings (specifically, the optimizer) may fill the stack and force memory allocations. If in the future you change the compiler version or settings, this could break this function by overwriting `dataPackageIndex` in memory. This is of low likelihood but will have a real impact. It’s a pitfall when accessing memory directly and is best to avoid it altogether.

## Recommendation
It may be possible to declare the for-loop variable above, but it is preferable to add 32 bytes to the `freeMemPtr` to stay on the safe side:

```
freeMemPtr := add(mload(FREE_MEMORY_PTR), 0x20)
```

## Status
- **Redstone:** Fixed in commit 145ae08f.
- **Cantina Managed:** Fixed.

## RedstoneConsumerBytesBase.sol - Code Review

### Context
`RedstoneConsumerBytesBase.sol#L161-L166`

### Description
This public function returns a memory pointer but does not work for external calls since memory does not persist to the calling context.

### Recommendation
The return values should be modified to:
- **Current Return**: 
  ```solidity
  returns (uint256 pointerToResultBytesInMemory)
  ```
- **Recommended Change**:
  ```solidity
  returns (bytes memory)
  ```

### Code Changes
```solidity
- bytes memory aggregatedBytes = aggregateByteValues(calldataPointersToValues);
- assembly {
- pointerToResultBytesInMemory := aggregatedBytes
- }
+ return aggregateByteValues(calldataPointersToValues);
```

### Redstone
Currently, this contract isn't used and will not be used in the future. It also wasn’t in the scope of the audit. We are aware of the risks and shortcomings of the workarounds we have in the `RedstoneConsumerBytesBase.sol`.

### Cantina Managed
Acknowledged.
